## High Priority

## Current Priority Gaps

- Add a focused regression that verifies runtime full-matrix copy and checklist remain JS/HTML/CSS-only.
- Add a contract test that fails if unsupported language entries reappear in Applications catalog.
- Add a lightweight smoke contract for Dev Terminal help text to keep command list aligned with supported runtime scope.
- Add focused assertion that sandbox run status + console marker pairing stays deterministic for JS/HTML/CSS templates.

## Completed Recently

- Added focused contract coverage for workspace preview sanitization and local asset inlining.
- Simplified runtime validation templates for deterministic marker-based pass/fail output.
- Removed unsupported runtime branches and aligned tests to web-language-only execution.
