# AI Memory for FAZ IDE

This folder stores operational memory that helps keep releases stable and recoverable.
Treat it as a lightweight runbook for daily development and emergency fixes.

## Update flow (quick)

- Update the relevant memory file after meaningful changes.
- Keep entries concise, factual, and timestamped when useful.
- Prefer appending new entries over rewriting history.

## Rules

- Do not store secrets, credentials, or private tokens.
- Keep references path-relative and deterministic.
- Record failures with exact failing command names when possible.
